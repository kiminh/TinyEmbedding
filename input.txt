352 <cs.MS> <cs.LG> Deep Learning Framework From Scratch Using Numpy <sep> This work is a rigorous development of a complete and general-purpose deep learning framework from the ground up. The fundamental components of deep learning - automatic differentiation and gradient methods of optimizing multivariable scalar functions - are developed from elementary calculus and implemented in a sensible object-oriented approach using only Python and the Numpy library. Demonstrations of solved problems using the framework, named ArrayFlow, include a computer vision classification task, solving for the shape of a catenary, and a 2nd order differential equation.
280 <physics.geo-ph> Characterizing the nonlinear interaction of S- and P-waves in a rock sample <sep> The nonlinear elastic response of rocks is known to be caused by the rocks' microstructure, particularly cracks and fluids. This paper presents a method for characterizing the nonlinearity of rocks in a laboratory scale experiment with a unique configuration. This configuration has been designed to open up the possibility the nonlinear characterization of rocks as an imaging tool in a field scenario. The nonlinear interaction of two traveling waves: a low-amplitude 500 kHz P-wave probe and a high-amplitude 50 kHz S-wave pump has been studied on a room-dry 15 x 15x 3 cm slab of Berea sandstone. Changes in the arrival time of the P-wave probe as it passes through the perturbation created by the traveling S-wave pump were recorded. Waveforms were time gated to simulate a semi-infinite medium. The shear wave phase relative to the P-wave probe signal was varied with resultant changes in the P-wave probe arrival time of up to 100 ns, corresponding to a change in elastic properties of 0.2%. In order to estimate the strain in our sample, ae also measured the particle velocity at the sample surface to scale a finite difference linear elastic simulation to estimate the complex strain field in the sample, on the order of $10^{-6}$, induced by the S-wave pump. We derived a fourth order elastic model to relate the changes in elasticity to the pump strain components. We recover quadratic and cubic nonlinear parameters: $\tilde{\beta}=-872$, $\tilde{\delta}=-1.1\times10^{10}$, respectively, at room-temperature and when particle motions of the pump and probe waves are aligned. Temperature fluctuations are correlated to changes in the recovered values of $\tilde{\beta}$ and $\tilde{\delta}$ and we find that the nonlinear parameter changes when the particle motions are orthogonal. No evidence of slow dynamics was seen in our measurements.
301 <cond-mat.mes-hall> Spin Transfer Torque in the Semiconductor/Ferromagnetic Structure in the Presence of Rashba Effect <sep> Spin transfer torque in magnetic structures occurs when the transverse component of the spin current that flows from the nonmagnetic medium to ferromagnetic medium are absorbed by the interface. In this paper, considering the Rashba effect on semiconductor region, we have discussed the spin transfer torque in semiconductor/ferromagnetic structure and obtained the components of spin-current density for two models: (I)-single electron and (II)- the distribution of electrons. We have shown that whatever the difference between Fermi surfaces in semiconductor and Fermi spheres for the up and down spins in ferromagnetic increase, the transmission probability decreases. The obtained results for the values used in this article illustrate that Rashba effect increases the difference between a Fermi sphere in semiconductors and Fermi sphere for the up and down spins in ferromagnetic. The results also show that the Rashba effect, brings an additional contribution to the components of spin transfer torque, which is not exist in the absence of the Rashba interaction. Moreover, the Rashba term has also different effects on the transverse components of the spin torque transfer.
152 <astro-ph> Accretion Disc Evolution in DW Ursae Majoris: A Photometric Study <sep> We present an analysis of CCD photometric observations of the eclipsing novalike cataclysmic variable DW UMa obtained in two different luminosity states: high and intermediate. The star presents eclipses with very different depth: ~1.2 mag in the high and ~3.4 mag in the intermediate state. Eclipse mapping reveals that this difference is almost entirely due to the changes in the accretion disc radius: from ~0.5RL1 in the intermediate state to ~0.75RL1 in the high state (RL1 is the distance from the white dwarf to the first Lagrangian point). In the intermediate state, the entire disc is eclipsed while in the high state, its outer part remains visible. We also find that the central intensity of the disc is nearly the same in the two luminosity states and that it is the increase of the disc radius that is responsible for the final rise from the 1999/2000 low state. We find that the intensity profile of the disc is rather flat and suggest a possible explanation. We also discuss the effect of using a more realistic limb-darkening law on the disc temperatures inferred from eclipse mapping experiments. Periodogram analysis of the high state data reveals "positive superhumps" with a period of 0.1455 in 2002 and 0.1461 in 2003, in accord with the results of Patterson et al. However, we cannot confirm the quasi-periodic oscillations reported by these authors. We obtain an updated orbital ephemeris of DW UMa: Tmin[HJD]=2446229.00687(9)+0.136606527(3)E.
322 <math.GT> Index Polynomials for Virtual Tangles <sep> We generalize the index polynomial invariant to the case of virtual tangles. Three polynomial invariants result from this generalization; we give a brief overview of their definition and some basic properties.
86 <cond-mat.stat-mech> Sluggish Kinetics in the Parking Lot Model <sep> We investigate, both analytically and by computer simulation, the kinetics of a microscopic model of hard rods adsorbing on a linear substrate. For a small, but finite desorption rate, the system reaches the equilibrium state very slowly, and the long-time kinetics display three successive regimes: an algebraic one where the density varies as $1/t$, a logarithmic one where the density varies as $1/ln(t)$, followed by a terminal exponential approach. A mean-field approach fails to predict the relaxation rate associated with the latter. We show that the correct answer can only be provided by using a systematic description based on a gap-distribution approach.
280 <quant-ph> Information-Based Physics, Influence, and Forces <sep> In recent works, Knuth and Bahreyni have demonstrated that the concepts of space and time are emergent in a coarse-grained model of direct particle-particle influence. In addition, Knuth demonstrated that observer-made inferences regarding the free particle, which is defined as a particle that influences others, but is not itself influenced, result in a situation identical to the Feynman checkerboard model of the Dirac equation. This suggests that the same theoretical framework that gives rise to an emergent spacetime is consistent with quantum mechanics. In this paper, we begin to explore the effect of influence on the emergent properties of a particle. This initial study suggests that when a particle is influenced, it is interpreted as accelerating in a manner consistent with special relativity implying that, at least in this situation, influence can be conceived of as a force.
263 <cs.LO> <cs.PF> Proceedings 11th International Workshop on Quantitative Aspects of Programming Languages and Systems <sep> Quantitative aspects of computation are important and sometimes essential in characterising the behavior and determining the properties of systems. They are related to the use of physical quantities (storage space, time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as mathematical quantities (e.g. probability and measures for reliability, security and trust). Such quantities play a central role in defining both the model of systems (architecture, language design, semantics) and the methodologies and tools for the analysis and verification of system properties. The aim of this workshop is to discuss the explicit use of quantitative information such as time and probabilities either directly in the model or as a tool for the analysis of systems.
169 <cs.DS> <cs.DM> Tightness of LP via Max-product Belief Propagation <sep> We investigate the question of tightness of linear programming (LP) relaxation for finding a maximum weight independent set (MWIS) in sparse random weighted graphs. We show that an edge-based LP relaxation is asymptotically tight for Erdos-Renyi graph $G(n,c/n)$ for $c \leq 2e$ and random regular graph $G(n,r)$ for $r\leq 4$ when node weights are i.i.d. with exponential distribution of mean 1. We establish these results, through a precise relation between the tightness of LP relaxation and convergence of the max-product belief propagation algorithm. We believe that this novel method of understanding structural properties of combinatorial problems through properties of iterative procedure such as the max-product should be of interest in its own right.
197 <hep-th> Matrix Model Maps and Reconstruction of AdS SUGRA Interactions <sep> We consider the question of reconstructing (cubic) SUGRA interactions in AdS/CFT. The method we introduce is based on the matrix model maps (MMP) which were previously successfully employed at the linearized level. The strategy is to start with the map for 1/2 BPS configurations which is exactly known (to all orders) in the hamiltonian framework. We then use the extension of the matrix model map with the corresponding Ward identities to completely specify the interaction. A central point in this construction is the non-vanishing of off-shell interactions (even for highest-weight states).
253 <math.CV> The Hardy-Littlewood Lemma and the estimate of the $\dib$-Neumann problem in a general norm <sep> We prove a generalized Hardy-Littlewood lemma on a non-smooth domain in "$f$-norm" and give an application to a corresponding estimate for the $\dib$-Neumann problem by means of suitable weights.
327 <gr-qc> <quant-ph> Parameter estimation for a Lorentz invariance violation <sep> We employ techniques from quantum estimation theory (QET) to estimate the Lorentz violation parameters in the 1+3-dimensional flat spacetime. We obtain and discuss the expression of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) in terms of the Lorentz violation parameter $\sigma_0$ and the momentum k of the created particles. We show that the maximum QFI is achieved for a specific momentum $k_{\mathrm{max}}$. We also find that the optimal precision of estimation of the Lorentz violation parameter is obtained near the Planck scale.
140 <cond-mat.supr-con> <cond-mat.mes-hall> Andreev conductance of a domain wall <sep> At low temperatures, the transport through a superconductor-ferromagnet tunnel interface is due to tunneling of electrons in pairs. Exchange field of a monodomain ferromagnet aligns electron spins and suppresses the two electron tunneling. The presence of the domain walls at the SF interface strongly enhances the subgap current. The Andreev conductance is proven to be proportional to the total length of domain walls at the SF interface.
315 <astro-ph.CO> <gr-qc> <hep-ph> <hep-th> Dark Energy after GW170817: dead ends and the road ahead <sep> Multi-messenger gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has commenced with the detection of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated electromagnetic counterparts. The almost coincident observation of both signals places an exquisite bound on the GW speed $|c_g/c-1|\leq5\cdot10^{-16}$. We use this result to probe the nature of dark energy (DE), showing that a large class of scalar-tensor theories and DE models are highly disfavored. As an example we consider the covariant Galileon, a cosmologically viable, well motivated gravity theory which predicts a variable GW speed at low redshift. Our results eliminate any late-universe application of these models, as well as their Horndeski and most of their beyond Horndeski generalizations. Three alternatives (and their combinations) emerge as the only possible scalar-tensor DE models: 1) restricting Horndeski's action to its simplest terms, 2) applying a conformal transformation which preserves the causal structure and 3) compensating the different terms that modify the GW speed (to be robust, the compensation has to be independent on the background on which GWs propagate). Our conclusions extend to any other gravity theory predicting varying $c_g$ such as Einstein-Aether, Ho\v{r}ava gravity, Generalized Proca, TeVeS and other MOND-like gravities.
340 <math.CO> Projections of antichains <sep> A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is called a weak antichain if it does not contain two elements $x$ and $y$ satisfying $x_i<y_i$ for all $i$. Engel, Mitsis, Pelekis and Reiher showed that for any weak antichain $A$, the sum of the sizes of its $(n-1)$-dimensional projections must be at least as large as its size $|A|$. They asked what the smallest possible value of the gap between these two quantities is in terms of $|A|$. We answer this question by giving an explicit weak antichain attaining this minimum for each possible value of $|A|$. In particular, we show that sets of the form $A_N=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}^n: 0\leq x_j\leq N-1$ for all $j$ and $x_i=0$ for some $i\}$ minimise the gap among weak antichains of size $|A_N|$.
171 <cond-mat.stat-mech> Cost of s-fold Decisions in Exact Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac Statistics <sep> The exact forms of the degenerate Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB), Bose-Einstein (BE) and Fermi-Dirac (FD) entropy functions, derived by Boltzmann's principle without the Stirling approximation (Niven, Physics Letters A, 342(4) (2005) 286), are further examined. Firstly, an apparent paradox in quantisation effects is resolved using the Laplace-Jaynes interpretation of probability. The energy cost of learning that a system, distributed over s equiprobable states, is in one such state (an s-fold decision) is then calculated for each statistic. The analysis confirms that the cost depends on one's knowledge of the number of entities N and (for BE and FD statistics) the degeneracy, extending the findings of Niven (2005).
286 <cond-mat.mtrl-sci> Observation of Rapid Change of Crystalline Structure during the Phase Transition of the Palladium-Hydrogen System <sep> We performed an X-ray diffraction experiment while palladium bulk absorbed and desorbed hydrogen to investigate the behavior of the crystalline lattice during the phase transition between the $\alpha$ phase and $\beta$ phase. Fast growth of $\beta$ phase was observed around x=0.1 and x=0.45 of PdH$_x$. In addition, slight compression of the lattice at high hydrogen concentration and increase in the lattice constant and the line width of the $\alpha$ phase after a cycle of absorption and desorption of hydrogen was observed. These behavior correlated with the change in the sample length, which may infer that the change in shape was related to the phase transition.
319 <hep-ph> <astro-ph.HE> A Sterile Neutrino Origin for the Upward Directed Cosmic Ray Showers Detected by ANITA <sep> The ANITA balloon experiment has recently observed several ~EeV cascade events at an angle below the horizon that renders any Standard Model (SM) interpretation unlikely as the Earth is significantly opaque to all SM particles at such energies. In this paper, we study a sterile neutrino interpretation of these events, calculating the angular acceptance of cascades and the relative sensitivities of several experiments to a cascade initiated by an EeV sterile neutrino. We find that ANITA is uniquely sensitive to this type of upward directed cascade signal over a wide portion of the sky and from the direction of the two observed events has a transient acceptance roughly equivalent to that of the IceCube experiment.
189 <math.PR> Williams' decomposition of the L\'evy continuous random tree and simultaneous extinction probability for populations with neutral mutations <sep> We consider an initial Eve-population and a population of neutral mutants, such that the total population dies out in finite time. We describe the evolution of the Eve-population and the total population with continuous state branching processes, and the neutral mutation procedure can be seen as an immigration process with intensity proportional to the size of the population. First we establish a Williams' decomposition of the genealogy of the total population given by a continuous random tree, according to the ancestral lineage of the last individual alive. This allows us give a closed formula for the probability of simultaneous extinction of the Eve-population and the total population.
338 <astro-ph.SR> <astro-ph.EP> Dynamical masses for the triple system HD 28363 in the Hyades cluster <sep> The star HD 28363 in the Hyades cluster has been known for over a century as a visual binary with a period of 40 yr. The secondary is, in turn, a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a 21-day period. Here we report extensive spectroscopic monitoring of this hierarchical triple system that reveals the spectral lines of the third star for the first time. Combined with astrometric information, this makes it possible to determine the dynamical masses of all three stars. Only six other binaries in the Hyades have had their individual component masses determined dynamically. We infer the properties of the system by combining our radial velocity measurements with visual observations, lunar occultation measurements, and with proper motions from the Hipparcos and Gaia missions that provide a constraint on the astrometric acceleration. We derive a mass of 1.341 +/- 0.026/0.024 M(Sun) for the visual primary, and 1.210 +/- 0.021 M(Sun) and 0.781 +/- 0.014 M(Sun) for the other two stars. These measurements along with those for the other six systems establish an empirical mass-luminosity relation in the Hyades that is in broad agreement with current models of stellar evolution for the known age and chemical composition of the cluster.
301 <math.AP> <math.FA> Local Well-Posedness for the Derivative Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with $L^2$ Subcritical Data <sep> We will show its local well-posedness in modulation spaces $M^{1/2}_{2,q}({\Real})$ $(2\leq q<\infty) $. It is well-known that $H^{1/2}$ is a critical Sobolev space of DNLS so that it is locally well-posedness in $H^s$ for $s\geq 1/2$ and ill-posed in $H^{s'}$ with $s'<1/2.$ Noticing that that $M^{1/2}_{2,q} \subset B^{1/q}_{2,q}$ is a sharp embedding and $L^2 \subset B^0_{2,\infty}$, our result contains all of the subcritical data in $M^{1/2}_{2,q}$, which contains a class of functions in $L^2\setminus H^{1/2}$.
225 <hep-ph> Resurrecting No-Scale Supergravity Phenomenology <sep> In the context of phenomenological models in which the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters of the MSSM become universal at some unification scale, M_{in}, above the GUT scale, \mgut, it is possible that all the scalar mass parameters m_0, the trilinear couplings A_0 and the bilinear Higgs coupling B_0 vanish simultaneously, as in no-scale supergravity. Using these no-scale inputs in a renormalization-group analysis of the minimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUT model, we pay careful attention to the matching of parameters at the GUT scale. We delineate the region of M_{in}, m_{1/2} and \tan \beta where the resurrection of no-scale supergravity is possible, taking due account of the relevant phenomenological constraints such as electroweak symmetry breaking, m_h, b \to s \gamma, the neutralino cold dark matter density \ohsq and g_\mu - 2. No-scale supergravity survives in an L-shaped strip of parameter space, with one side having with one side having m_{1/2} \gappeq 200 {\rm GeV}, the second (orthogonal) side having M_{in} \gappeq 5 \times 10^{16} GeV. Depending on the relative signs and magnitudes of the GUT superpotential couplings, these may be connected to form a triangle whose third side is a hypotenuse at larger M_{in}, m_{1/2} and \tan \beta, whose presence and location depend on the GUT superpotential parameters. We compare the prospects for detecting sparticles at the LHC in no-scale supergravity with those in the CMSSM and the NUHM.
33 <gr-qc> Quantum Observables and Recollapsing Dynamics <sep> Within a simple quantization scheme, observables for a large class of finite dimensional time reparametrization invariant systems may be constructed by integration over the manifold of time labels. This procedure is shown to produce a complete set of densely defined operators on a physical Hilbert space for which an inner product is identified and to provide reasonable results for simple test cases. Furthermore, many of these observables have a clear interpretation in the classical limit and we use this to demonstrate that, for a class of minisuperspace models including LRS Bianchi IX and the Kantowski-Sachs model this quantization agrees with classical physics in predicting that such spacetimes recollapse.
343 <astro-ph.GA> The OTELO survey. III. Demography, morphology, IR luminosity and environment of AGN hosts <sep> We take advantage of the capabilities of the OTELO survey to select and study the AGN population in the field. We performed an analysis of the properties of these objects, including their demography, morphology, and IR luminosity. Focusing on the population of H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 0.4$, we also aim to study the environments of AGN and non-AGN galaxies at that redshift. We make use of the multiwavelength catalog of objects in the field compiled by the OTELO survey, unique in terms of minimum line flux and equivalent width. The OTELO pseudo-spectra allow the identification of emission lines and the spectral classification of the sources. We obtained a sample of 72 AGNs in the field of OTELO, selected with four different methods in the optical, X-rays, and mid-infrared bands. We find that using X-rays is the most efficient way to select AGNs. An analysis was performed on the AGN population of OTELO in order to characterize its members. At $z \sim 0.4$, we find that up to 26\% of our H$\alpha$ emitters are AGNs. At that redshift, AGNs are found in identical environments to non-AGNs, although they represent the most clustered group when compared to passive and star-forming galaxies. The majority of our AGNs at any redshift were classified as late-type galaxies, including a 16\% proportion of irregulars. Another 16\% of AGNs show signs of interactions or mergers. Regarding the infrared luminosity, we are able to recover all the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the field of OTELO up to $z\sim 1.6$. We find that the proportion of LIRGs and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) is higher among the AGN population, and that ULIRGs show a higher fraction of AGNs than LIRGs.
314 <cs.NI> <cs.PF> Radio Irregularity Model in OMNeT++ <sep> Radio irregularity is a non-negligible phenomenon that has an impact on protocol performances. For instance, irregularity in radio range leads to asymmetric links that cause the loss of packets in different directions. In order to investigate its effect, the Radio Irregularity Model (RIM) is proposed that takes into account the irregularity of a radio range and estimates path losses in an anisotropic environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide details of the RIM model developed in the INET Framework of the OMNeT++ simulator that can be used to investigate the impact of radio irregularity on protocol performance.
343 <stat.AP> Predictive Risk Analysis in Collective Risk Model: Choices between Historical Frequency and Aggregate Severity <sep> Typical risk classification procedure in insurance is consists of a priori risk classification determined by observable risk characteristics, and a posteriori risk classification where the premium is adjusted to reflect the policyholder's claim history. While using the full claim history data is optimal in a posteriori risk classification procedure, i.e. giving premium estimators with the minimal variances, some insurance sectors, however, only use partial information of the claim history for determining the appropriate premium to charge. Classical examples include that auto insurances premium are determined by the claim frequency data and workers' compensation insurances are based on the aggregate severity. The motivation for such practice is to have a simplified and efficient posteriori risk classification procedure which is customized to the involved insurance policy. This paper compares the relative efficiency of the two simplified posteriori risk classifications, i.e. based on frequency versus severity, and provides the mathematical framework to assist practitioners in choosing the most appropriate practice.
97 <astro-ph> <hep-ph> The Increase in the Primordial He-4 Yield in the Two-Doublet Four-Neutrino Mixing Scheme <sep> We assess the effects on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) of lepton number generation in the early universe resulting from the two-doublet four-neutrino mass/mixing scheme. It has been argued that this neutrino mass/mixing arrangement gives the most viable fit to the existing data. We study full 4 x 4 mixing matrices and show how possible symmetries in these can affect the BBN He-4 abundance yields. Though there is as yet no consensus on the reliability of BBN calculations with neutrino flavor mixing, we show that, in the case where the sign of the lepton number asymmetry is unpredictable, BBN considerations may pick out specific relationships between mixing angles. In particular, reconciling the observed light element abundances with a \bar\nu_\mu <-> \bar\nu_e oscillation interpretation of LSND would allow unique new constraints on the neutrino mixing angles in this model.
319 <hep-ph> Electromagnetic transition form factors of baryons in a relativistic Faddeev approach <sep> The covariant Faddeev approach which describes baryons as relativistic three-quark bound states and is based on the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations of QCD is briefly reviewed. All elements, including especially the baryons' three-body-wave-functions, the quark propagators and the dressed quark-photon vertex, are calculated from a well-established approximation for the quark-gluon interaction. Selected previous results of this approach for the spectrum and elastic electromagnetic form factors of ground-state baryons and resonances are reported. The main focus of this talk is a presentation and discussion of results from a recent investigation of the electromagnetic transition form factors between ground-state octet and decuplet baryons as well as the octet-only $\Sigma^0$ to $\Lambda$ transition.
291 <cs.SI> Temporal Matrix Factorization for Tracking Concept Drift in Individual User Preferences <sep> The matrix factorization (MF) technique has been widely adopted for solving the rating prediction problem in recommender systems. The MF technique utilizes the latent factor model to obtain static user preferences (user latent vectors) and item characteristics (item latent vectors) based on historical rating data. However, in the real world user preferences are not static but full of dynamics. Though there are several previous works that addressed this time varying issue of user preferences, it seems (to the best of our knowledge) that none of them is specifically designed for tracking concept drift in individual user preferences. Motivated by this, we develop a Temporal Matrix Factorization approach (TMF) for tracking concept drift in each individual user latent vector. There are two key innovative steps in our approach: (i) we develop a modified stochastic gradient descent method to learn an individual user latent vector at each time step, and (ii) by the Lasso regression we learn a linear model for the transition of the individual user latent vectors. We test our method on a synthetic dataset and several real datasets. In comparison with the original MF, our experimental results show that our temporal method is able to achieve lower root mean square errors (RMSE) for both the synthetic and real datasets. One interesting finding is that the performance gain in RMSE is mostly from those users who indeed have concept drift in their user latent vectors at the time of prediction. In particular, for the synthetic dataset and the Ciao dataset, there are quite a few users with that property and the performance gains for these two datasets are roughly 20% and 5%, respectively.
279 <astro-ph.CO> Gravitational Lensing of Cosmological 21cm Emission <sep> We investigate the feasibility of measuring weak gravitational lensing using 21cm intensity mapping with special emphasis on the performance of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We find that the current design for SKA-Mid should be able to measure the evolution of the lensing power spectrum at z~2-3 using this technique. This will be a probe of the expansion history of the universe and gravity at a unique range in redshift. The signal-to-noise is found to be highly dependent on evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction in the universe with a higher HI density resulting in stronger signal. With realistic models for this, SKA Phase 1 should be capable of measuring the lensing power spectrum and its evolution. The signal-to-noise's dependence on the area and diameter of the telescope array is quantified. We further demonstrate the applications of this technique by applying it to two specific coupled dark energy models that would be difficult to observationally distinguish without information from this range of redshift. We also investigate measuring the lensing signal with 21cm emission from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using SKA-Low and find that it is unlikely to constrain cosmological parameters because of the small survey size, but could provide a map of the dark matter within a small region of the sky.
324 <math.SG> On Darboux Theorem for symplectic forms on direct limits of symplectic Banach manifolds <sep> Given an ascending sequence of weak symplectic Banach manifolds on which the Darboux theorem is true, we can ask about conditions under which the Darboux Theorem is also true on the direct limit. We will show in general, without very strong conditions, the answer is negative. In particular we give an example of an ascending weak symplectic Banach manifolds on which the Darboux Theorem is true but not on the direct limit. In a second part, we illustrate this discussion in the context of an ascending sequences of Sobolev manifolds of loops in symplectic finite dimensional manifolds. This context gives rise to an example of direct limit of weak symplectic Banach manifolds on which the Darboux theorem is true around any point.
298 <astro-ph.CO> What does the Bullet Cluster tell us about self-interacting dark matter? <sep> We perform numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56 (the Bullet Cluster), including the effects of elastic dark matter scattering. In a similar manner to the stripping of gas by ram pressure, dark matter self-interactions would transfer momentum between the two galaxy cluster dark matter haloes, causing them to lag behind the collisionless galaxies. The absence of an observed separation between the dark matter and stellar components in the Bullet Cluster has been used to place upper limits on the cross-section for dark matter scattering. We emphasise the importance of analysing simulations in an observationally-motivated manner, finding that the way in which the positions of the various components are measured can have a larger impact on derived constraints on dark matter's self-interaction cross-section than reasonable changes to the initial conditions for the merger. In particular, we find that the methods used in previous studies to place some of the tightest constraints on this cross-section do not reflect what is done observationally, and overstate the Bullet Cluster's ability to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. We introduce the first simulations of the Bullet Cluster including both self-interacting dark matter and gas. We find that as the gas is stripped it introduces radially-dependent asymmetries into the stellar and dark matter distributions. As the techniques used to determine the positions of the dark matter and galaxies are sensitive to different radial scales, these asymmetries can lead to erroneously measured offsets between dark matter and galaxies even when they are spatially coincident.
330 <astro-ph.HE> <gr-qc> A kilonova associated with GRB 070809 <sep> For on-axis typical short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), the forward shock emission is usually so bright that renders the identification of kilonovae (also known as macronovae) in the early afterglow ($t<0.5$ d) phase rather challenging. This is why previously no thermal-like kilonova component has been identified at such early time except in the off-axis dim GRB 170817A associated with GW170817. Here we report the identification of an unusual optical radiation component in GRB 070809 at $t\sim 0.47$ d, thanks plausibly to the very-weak/subdominant forward shock emission. The optical emission with a very red spectrum is well in excess of the extrapolation of the X-ray emission that is distinguished by an unusually hard spectrum, which is at odds with the forward shock afterglow prediction but can be naturally interpreted as a kilonova. Our finding supports the speculation that kilonovae are ubiquitous , and demonstrates the possibility of revealing the neutron star merger origin with the early afterglow data of some typical sGRBs that take place well beyond the sensitive radius of the advanced gravitational wave detectors and hence the opportunity of organizing dedicated follow-up observations for events of interest.
347 <math.CO> <math.PR> Threshold for weak saturation stability <sep> We study wsat(G(n, p), K_s), the weak K_s-saturation number of the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n, p), where K_s is the complete graph on s vertices. Korandi and Sudakov proved that the weak K_s-saturation number of K_n is stable, i.e. it remains the same after removing every edge with constant probability. We prove that there exists a threshold function for this stability property and give upper and lower bounds on the threshold. Having this, we simplify the proof of Korandi and Sudakov and make their result more general.
215 <math.AG> <math.AC> Equicharacteristic etale cohomology in dimension one <sep> The Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula expresses the Euler characteristic of an etale sheaf on a curve in terms of local data. The purpose of this paper is to prove a version of the G-O-S formula which applies to equicharacteristic sheaves (a bound, rather than an equality). This follows a proposal of R. Pink. The basis for the result is the characteristic-p "Riemann-Hilbert" correspondence, which relates equicharacteristic etale sheaves to O_{F, X}-modules. In the paper we prove a version of this correspondence for curves, considering both local and global settings. In the process we define an invariant, the "minimal root index," which measures the local complexity of an O_{F, X}-module. This invariant provides the local terms for the main result.
231 <astro-ph.GA> Radial Velocity and Metallicity of the Globular Cluster IC4499 Obtained with AAOmega <sep> We present radial velocity and metallicity measurements for the far-southern Galactic globular cluster IC4499. We selected several hundred target red giant stars in and around the cluster from the 2MASS point source catalog, and obtained spectra at the near-infrared calcium triplet using the AAOmega spectrograph. Observations of giants in globular clusters M4, M22, and M68 were taken to provide radial velocity and metallicity comparison objects. Based on velocity data we conclude that 43 of our targets are cluster members, by far the largest sample of IC4499 giants spectroscopically studied. We determine the mean heliocentric radial velocity of the cluster to be 31.5 plus or minus 0.4 km/s, and find the most likely central velocity dispersion to be 2.5 plus or minus 0.5 km/s. This leads to a dynamical mass estimate for the cluster of 93 plus or minus 37 thousand solar masses. We are sensitive to cluster rotation down to an amplitude of about 1 km/s, but no evidence for cluster rotation is seen. The cluster metallicity is found to be [Fe/H] = -1.52 plus or minus 0.12 on the Carretta-Gratton scale. The radial velocity of the cluster, previously highly uncertain, is consistent with membership in the Monoceros tidal stream, but also with a halo origin. The horizontal branch morphology of the cluster is slightly redder than average for its metallicity, but it is likely not unusually young compared to other clusters of the halo. The new constraints on the cluster kinematics and metallicity may give insight into its extremely high specific frequency of RR Lyrae stars.
290 <cs.CV> Multivariate Median Filters and Partial Differential Equations <sep> Multivariate median filters have been proposed as generalisations of the well-established median filter for grey-value images to multi-channel images. As multivariate median, most of the recent approaches use the $L^1$ median, i.e.\ the minimiser of an objective function that is the sum of distances to all input points. Many properties of univariate median filters generalise to such a filter. However, the famous result by Guichard and Morel about approximation of the mean curvature motion PDE by median filtering does not have a comparably simple counterpart for $L^1$ multivariate median filtering. We discuss the affine equivariant Oja median and the affine equivariant transformation--retransformation $L^1$ median as alternatives to $L^1$ median filtering. We analyse multivariate median filters in a space-continuous setting, including the formulation of a space-continuous version of the transformation--retransformation $L^1$ median, and derive PDEs approximated by these filters in the cases of bivariate planar images, three-channel volume images and three-channel planar images. The PDEs for the affine equivariant filters can be interpreted geometrically as combinations of a diffusion and a principal-component-wise curvature motion contribution with a cross-effect term based on torsions of principal components. Numerical experiments are presented that demonstrate the validity of the approximation results.
352 <cs.AR> Addressing Resiliency of In-Memory Floating Point Computation <sep> In-memory computing (IMC) can eliminate the data movement between processor and memory which is a barrier to the energy-efficiency and performance in Von-Neumann computing. Resistive RAM (RRAM) is one of the promising devices for IMC applications (e.g. integer and Floating Point (FP) operations and random logic implementation) due to low power consumption, fast operation, and small footprint in crossbar architecture. In this paper, we propose FAME, a pipelined FP arithmetic (adder/subtractor) using RRAM crossbar based IMC. A novel shift circuitry is proposed to lower the shift overhead during FP operations. Since 96% of the RRAMs used in our architecture are in High Resistance State (HRS), we propose two approaches namely Shift-At-The-Output (SATO) and Force To VDD (FTV) (ground (FTG)) to mitigate Stuck-at-1 (SA1) failures. In both techniques, the fault-free RRAMs are exploited to perform the computation by using an extra clock cycle. Although performance degrades by 50%, SATO can handle 50% of the faults whereas FTV can handle 99% of the faults in the RRAM-based compute array at low power and area overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed single precision FP adder consumes 335 pJ and 322 pJ for NAND-NAND and NOR-NOR based implementations, respectively. The area overheads of SATO and FTV are 28.5% and 9.5%, respectively.
347 <cond-mat.mtrl-sci> Thermal Transfer in Amorphous Superionic Systems <sep> Using direct atomic simulations, the vibration scattering time scales are characterized, and then the nature and the quantitative weight of thermal excitations are investigated in an example system Li2S from its amorphous solid state to its partial-solid partial-liquid and, liquid states. For the amorphous solid state at 300 K, the vibration scattering time ranges a few femtoseconds to several picoseconds. As a result, both the progagons and diffusons are the main heat carriers and contribute largely to the total thermal conductivity. The enhancement of scattering among vibrations and between vibrations and free ions flow due to the increase of temperature, will lead to a large reduction of the scattering time scale and the acoustic vibrational thermal conductivity, i.e., 0.8 W/mK at 300 K to 0.56 W/mK in the partial solid partial liquid Li2S at 700 K. In this latter state, the thermal conductivity contributed by convection increases to the half of the total, as a result of the usually neglected cross-correlation between the virial term and the free ions' flow. The vibrational scattering time can be as large as ~ 1.5 picoseconds yet, and the vibrational conductivity is reduced to a still significant 0.42 W/mK highlighting the unexpected role of acoustic transverse and longitudinal vibrations in liquid Li2S at 1100 K. At this same temperature, the convection heat transfer takes overreaching 0.63 W/mK. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the thermal excitations at play in amorphous materials from solid to liquid.
208 <cs.DS> Binar Shuffle Algorithm: Shuffling Bit by Bit <sep> Frequently, randomly organized data is needed to avoid an anomalous operation of other algorithms and computational processes. An analogy is that a deck of cards is ordered within the pack, but before a game of poker or solitaire the deck is shuffled to create a random permutation. Shuffling is used to assure that an aggregate of data elements for a sequence S is randomly arranged, but avoids an ordered or partially ordered permutation. Shuffling is the process of arranging data elements into a random permutation. The sequence S as an aggregation of N data elements, there are N! possible permutations. For the large number of possible permutations, two of the possible permutations are for a sorted or ordered placement of data elements--both an ascending and descending sorted permutation. Shuffling must avoid inadvertently creating either an ascending or descending permutation. Shuffling is frequently coupled to another algorithmic function -- pseudo-random number generation. The efficiency and quality of the shuffle is directly dependent upon the random number generation algorithm utilized. A more effective and efficient method of shuffling is to use parameterization to configure the shuffle, and to shuffle into sub-arrays by utilizing the encoding of the data elements. The binar shuffle algorithm uses the encoding of the data elements and parameterization to avoid any direct coupling to a random number generation algorithm, but still remain a linear O(N) shuffle algorithm.
300 <math.AP> Gevrey Stability of Prandtl Expansions for 2D Navier-Stokes <sep> We investigate the stability of boundary layer solutions of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We consider shear flow solutions of Prandtl type : $$ u^\nu(t,x,y) \, = \, \big (U^E(t,y) + U^{BL}(t,\frac{y}{\sqrt{\nu}})\,, \, 0 \big )\, , \quad 0<\nu \ll 1\,. $$ We show that if $U^{BL}$ is monotonic and concave in $Y = y /\sqrt{\nu}$ then $u^\nu$ is stable over some time interval $(0,T)$, $T$ independent of $\nu$, under perturbations with Gevrey regularity in $x$ and Sobolev regularity in $y$. We improve in this way the classical stability results of Sammartino and Caflisch in analytic class (both in $x$ and $y$). Moreover, in the case where $U^{BL}$ is steady and strictly concave, our Gevrey exponent for stability is optimal. The proof relies on new and sharp resolvent estimates for the linearized Orr-Sommerfeld operator.
250 <hep-ph> <hep-ex> Seesaw Mechanism with Occam's Razor <sep> We discuss the seesaw mechanism which includes the minimum number of parameters for successful leptogenesis and three neutrino oscillations in the spirit of Occam's razor. We show that models with two right-handed neutrinos with two texture zeros supported by Occam's razor cannot fit the observed neutrino parameters consistently for the normal light neutrino mass hierarchy. For the inverted light neutrino mass hierarchy, on the other hand, we find that the models can fit the observed neutrino parameters consistently. Besides, we show that the model predicts the maximal Dirac CP-phase of the neutrino mixing matrix in the measurable range in the foreseeable future for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. We also show that the predicted effective Majorana neutrino mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay is around 50 meV which is also within reach of future experiments.
148 <cond-mat.dis-nn> A spherical perfect lens <sep> It has been recently proved that a slab of negative refractive index material acts as a perfect lens in that it makes accessible the sub-wavelength image information contained in the evanescent modes of a source. Here we elaborate on perfect lens solutions to spherical shells of negative refractive material where magnification of the near-field images becomes possible. The negative refractive materials then need to be spatially dispersive with $\epsilon(r) \sim 1/r$ and $\mu(r)\sim 1/r$. We concentrate on lens-like solutions for the extreme near-field limit. Then the conditions for the TM and TE polarized modes become independent of $\mu$ and $\epsilon$ respectively.
113 <hep-ph> The Standard Model Higgs in $\gamma \gamma$ Collisions <sep> For a Higgs boson below the $W^\pm$ threshold, the $\gamma \gamma$ collider option of a future linear $e^+ e^-$ machine is compelling. In this case one can measure the ``gold-plated'' loop induced $\Gamma (H \longrightarrow \gamma \gamma)$ partial width to high precision, testing various extensions of the Standard Model. With recent progress in the expected $\gamma \gamma$ luminosity at TESLA, we find that for a Higgs of 115 GeV a statistical accuracy of the two photon partial width of 1.4 % is possible. The total width depends thus solely on the accuracy of $BR(H \longrightarrow \gamma \gamma)$ and is of ${\cal O} (10 %)$.
304 <astro-ph.GA> <astro-ph.SR> Extremely metal-poor galaxy DDO 68: the LBV, H-alpha shells and the most luminous stars <sep> The paper presents new results of the ongoing study of the unusual Lynx-Cancer void galaxy DDO 68 with record-low-metallicity regions (12+log(O/H) ~7.14) of the current star formation (SF). They include: a) a new spectrum and photometry with the 6-m SAO RAS telescope (BTA) for the Luminous Blue Variable (LBV = DDO68-V1). Photometric data sets are complemented with those based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive images; b) the analysis of the DDO~68 supergiant shell (SGS) and the prominent smaller H-alpha arcs/shells visible at the HST image coupled with kinematics maps in H-alpha obtained with the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) at the BTA; c) the list of identified at the HST images of about 50 most luminous stars (-9.1 < M_V < -6.0 mag) related to star-forming regions with the known extremely low O/H. This is intended to pave the path for the actual science with the next generation of giant telescopes. We confirm the earlier hints on significant variations of the LBV optical light deriving its amplitude of dV > 3.7~mag for the first time. New data suggest that in 2008--2010 the LBV reached M_V = --10.5 and probably underwent a giant eruption. We argue that the structure of star-forming complexes along the SGS (`Northern Ring') perimeter provides evidence for the sequential induced SF episodes caused by the shell gas instabilities and gravitational collapse. The variability of some DDO~68 luminous extremely metal-poor stars can be monitored with medium-size telescopes at sites with superb seeing.
347 <cond-mat.str-el> Field evolution of the spin-liquid candidate YbMgGaO$_4$ <sep> We report magnetization, heat capacity, thermal expansion, and magnetostriction measurements down to millikelvin temperatures on the triangular antiferromagnet YbMgGaO$_4$. Our data exclude the formation of the distinct $\frac13$ plateau phase observed in other triangular antiferromagnets, but reveal plateaulike features in second derivatives of the free energy, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat, at $\mu_0H$ = 1.0 - 2.5 T for $H\parallel{}c$ and 2 - 5 T for $H\perp{}c$. Using Monte-Carlo simulations of a realistic spin Hamiltonian, we ascribe these features to nonmonotonic changes in the magnetization and the $\frac12$ plateau that is smeared out by the random distribution of exchange couplings in YbMgGaO$_4$.
347 <astro-ph.GA> <astro-ph.HE> Fe III emission in quasars: evidence for a dense turbulent medium <sep> Recent improvements to atomic energy-level data allow, for the first time, accurate predictions to be made for the Fe III line emission strengths in the spectra of luminous, $L_\text{bol}=10^{46}-10^{48}$ erg/s, Active Galactic Nuclei. The Fe III emitting gas must be primarily photoionized, consistent with observations of line reverberation. We use CLOUDY models exploring a wide range of parameter space, together with 26,500 rest-frame ultraviolet spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to constrain the physical conditions of the line emitting gas. The observed Fe III emission is best accounted for by dense ($n_H=10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas which is microturbulent, leading to smaller line optical depths and fluorescent excitation. Such high density gas appears to be present in the central regions of the majority of luminous quasars. Using our favoured model, we present theoretical predictions for the relative strengths of the Fe III UV34 $\lambda\lambda$1895,1914,1926 multiplet. This multiplet is blended with the Si III] $\lambda$1892 and C III] $\lambda$1909 emission lines and an accurate subtraction of UV34 is essential when using these lines to infer information about the physics of the broad line region in quasars.
332 <gr-qc> Buchdahl compactness limit and gravitational field energy <sep> The main aim of this paper is essentially to point out that the Buchdahl compactness limit of a static object is given by \it{gravitational field energy being less than or equal to half of its non-gravitational matter energy}. It is thus entirely determined without any reference to interior distribution by the exterior unique solutions, the Schwarzschild for neutral and the Reissner-Nordstr{$\ddot o$}m for charged object. In terms of surface potential, it reads as $\Phi(R) = (M-Q^2/2R)/R \leq 4/9$ which translates to surface red-shift being less than or equal to $3$. It also prescribes an upper bound on charge an object could have, $Q^2/M^2 \leq 9/8 > 1$.
346 <q-bio.NC> On Kalman-Bucy filters, linear quadratic control and active inference <sep> Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control is a framework first introduced in control theory that provides an optimal solution to linear problems of regulation in the presence of uncertainty. This framework combines Kalman-Bucy filters for the estimation of hidden states with Linear Quadratic Regulators for the control of their dynamics. Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in neuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to sensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models. According to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian inference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active inference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational approximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others, perception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy minimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to LQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor control in biological systems based on a process of biased perception. In this note we compare the mathematical treatments of these two frameworks for linear systems, focusing on their respective assumptions and highlighting their commonalities and technical differences.
246 <math.AT> Visualizing Poincar\'e Duality <sep> We investigate some connections between two different ways of defining Poincar\'e Duality, and relate them geometrically to the level curve mapping.
175 <hep-ph> Glue in the pomeron from nonlinear k_\perp-factorization <sep> We derive the nonlinear k_\perp-factorization for the spectrum of jets in high-mass diffractive deep inelastic scattering as a function of three hard scales - the virtuality of the photon Q^2, the transverse momentum of the jet and the saturation scale Q_A. In contrast to all other hard reactions studied so far, we encounter a clash between the two definitions of the glue in the pomeron -- from the inclusive spectrum of leading quarks and the small-\beta evolution of the diffractive cross section. This clash casts a further shadow on customary applications of the familiar collinear factorization to a pQCD analysis of diffractive deep inelastic scattering.
268 <stat.ML> <math.ST> <stat.TH> High-dimensional learning of linear causal networks via inverse covariance estimation <sep> We establish a new framework for statistical estimation of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) when data are generated from a linear, possibly non-Gaussian structural equation model. Our framework consists of two parts: (1) inferring the moralized graph from the support of the inverse covariance matrix; and (2) selecting the best-scoring graph amongst DAGs that are consistent with the moralized graph. We show that when the error variances are known or estimated to close enough precision, the true DAG is the unique minimizer of the score computed using the reweighted squared l_2-loss. Our population-level results have implications for the identifiability of linear SEMs when the error covariances are specified up to a constant multiple. On the statistical side, we establish rigorous conditions for high-dimensional consistency of our two-part algorithm, defined in terms of a "gap" between the true DAG and the next best candidate. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamic programming may be used to select the optimal DAG in linear time when the treewidth of the moralized graph is bounded.
315 <eess.SP> On Power Allocation for Distributed Detection with Correlated Observations and Linear Fusion <sep> We consider a binary hypothesis testing problem in an inhomogeneous wireless sensor network, where a fusion center (FC) makes a global decision on the underlying hypothesis. We assume sensors observations are correlated Gaussian and sensors are unaware of this correlation when making decisions. Sensors send their modulated decisions over fading channels, subject to individual and/or total transmit power constraints. For parallel-access channel (PAC) and multiple-access channel (MAC) models, we derive modified deflection coefficient (MDC) of the test statistic at the FC with coherent reception.We propose a transmit power allocation scheme, which maximizes MDC of the test statistic, under three different sets of transmit power constraints: total power constraint, individual and total power constraints, individual power constraints only. When analytical solutions to our constrained optimization problems are elusive, we discuss how these problems can be converted to convex ones. We study how correlation among sensors observations, reliability of local decisions, communication channel model and channel qualities and transmit power constraints affect the reliability of the global decision and power allocation of inhomogeneous sensors.
276 <cond-mat.mtrl-sci> Synthesis of nanographite by laser induced thermal expansion of H2SO4 intercalated graphite lattice <sep> We have experimentally investigated the expansion mechanism induced by laser irradiation of H2SO4 intercalated graphite. Intercalated graphite materials irradiated by laser allows to study reactions occurring in confined chemical conditions. We find that the laser-assisted reaction process is characterized by a threshold temperature of about 140{\deg}C followed by a fast rate of heating which produces a large amount of overheated gases and causes a violent expansion of the graphite crystal. We investigate the morphological changes undergone by irradiated graphite filaments using a combination of thermal and visible imaging technique which allows for the quantitative determination of temporal evolution of the thermal field during the heating stage and exfoliation of the grain.
338 <cs.IR> <cs.AI> <cs.LG> <stat.ML> PMD: An Optimal Transportation-based User Distance for Recommender Systems <sep> Collaborative filtering, a widely-used recommendation technique, predicts a user's preference by aggregating the ratings from similar users. As a result, these measures cannot fully utilize the rating information and are not suitable for real world sparse data. To solve these issues, we propose a novel user distance measure named Preference Mover's Distance (PMD) which makes full use of all ratings made by each user. Our proposed PMD can properly measure the distance between a pair of users even if they have no co-rated items. We show that this measure can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well-studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Experimental results show that PMD can help achieve superior recommendation accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, especially when training data is very sparse.
227 <cond-mat.mtrl-sci> Specific heat study of Ga1-xMnxAs <sep> Specific heat measurements were used to study the magnetic phase transition in Ga1-xMnxAs. Two different types of Ga1-xMnxAs samples have been investigated. The sample with a Mn concentration of 1.6% shows insulating behavior, and the sample with a Mn concentration of 2.6% is metallic. The temperature dependence of the specific heat for both samples reveals a pronounced lambda-shaped peak near the Curie temperature, which indicates a second-order phase transition in these samples. The critical behavior of the specific heat for Ga1-xMnxAs samples is consistent with the mean-field behavior with Gaussian fluctuations of the magnetization in the close vicinity of TC.
247 <cond-mat.mes-hall> Spaser chains <sep> We show that depending on the values of the coupling constants, two different scenarios for the stationary behavior of a chain of interacting spasers may be realized: (1) all the spasers are synchronized and oscillate with a unique phase and (2) a nonlinear autowave travels along the chain. In the latter scenario, the traveling wave is harmonic unlike excitations in other known nonlinear systems. The amplitude of this wave is determined by pumping and the wavenumber is determined by the coupling constants. Due to the nonlinear nature of the system, any initial distribution of spasers' states evolves into one of these steady states.
306 <physics.gen-ph> Balance of O2 and H2 content under laser-induced breakdown of aqueous colloidal solutions <sep> Formation of molecular H2 and O2 is experimentally studied under laser exposure of water colloidal solution to radiation of a Nd:YAG laser at pulse duration of 10 ns and laser fluence in the liquid of order of 100 J/cm2. It is found the partial pressure of both H2 and O2 first increases with laser exposure time and saturates at exposures of order of 1 hour. The balance between O2 and H2 content depends on the laser energy fluence in the solution and is shifted towards H2 at high fluences. Possible mechanisms of formation of the dissociation products are discussed, from direct dissociation of H2O molecules by electrons of plasma breakdown to emission of laser-induced plasma in liquid.
277 <cond-mat.mtrl-sci> Seebeck Nanoantennas for Solar Energy Harvesting <sep> We propose a mid-infrared device based on thermocouple optical antennas for light sensing and energy harvesting applications. We numerically demonstrate that antennas are able to generate low-power dc signals by beneficing of the thermoelectric properties of the metals that constitute them. We theoretically evaluate the optical-to-electrical conversion efficiency for harvesting applications and finally discuss strategies to increase its performance. Thermocouple optical antennas therefore open the route toward the design of photovoltaic devices.
178 <physics.chem-ph> <physics.atm-clus> Rotational Energy Transfer in H2+H2 <sep> Quantum-mechanical close-coupling calculations for state-to-state cross sections and thermal rates are reported for H2+H2 collisions. Two recently developed potential energy surfaces (PES) for the H2-H2 system are applied, namely, the global potential surface from the work of A.I. Boothroyd, P.G. Martin, W.J. Keogh, M.J. Peterson, J. Chem. Phys., 116 (2002) 666, and a restricted, model surface from the works of P. Diep, J.K. Johnson, J. Chem. Phys., 113 (2000) 3480; ibid. 112, 4465. The low temperature limit is investigated. We found significant differences in cross sections and corresponding thermal rates calculated with these two PESs.
282 <hep-lat> Multipoint reweighting method and beta functions for the calculation of QCD equation of state <sep> We study a reweighting method aiming at numerical studies of QCD at finite density, in which the conventional Monte-Carlo method cannot be applied directly. One of the most important problems in the reweighting method is the overlap problem. To solve it, we propose to perform simulations at several simulation points and combine their results in the data analyses. In this report, we introduce this multipoint reweighting method and test if the method works well by measuring histograms of physical quantities. Using this method, we calculate the meson masses as continuous functions of the gauge coupling beta and the hopping parameters kappa in QCD at zero density. We then determine lines of constant physics in the (beta, kappa) space and evaluate the derivatives of the lattice spacing with respect to beta and kappa along the lines of constant physics (inverse of the beta functions), which are needed in a calculation of the equation of state.
229 <math.FA> A Characterisation of Anti-Lowner Functions <sep> According to a celebrated result by L\"owner, a real-valued function $f$ is operator monotone if and only if its L\"owner matrix, which is the matrix of divided differences $L_f=(\frac{f(x_i)-f(x_j)}{x_i-x_j})_{i,j=1}^N$, is positive semidefinite for every integer $N>0$ and any choice of $x_1,x_2,...,x_N$. In this paper we answer a question of R. Bhatia, who asked for a characterisation of real-valued functions $g$ defined on $(0,+\infty)$ for which the matrix of divided sums $K_g=(\frac{g(x_i)+g(x_j)}{x_i+x_j})_{i,j=1}^N$, which we call its anti-L\"owner matrix, is positive semidefinite for every integer $N>0$ and any choice of $x_1,x_2,...,x_N\in(0,+\infty)$. Such functions, which we call anti-L\"owner functions, have applications in the theory of Lyapunov-type equations.
104 <hep-th> The type IIA NS5--Brane <sep> The kappa--invariant worldvolume action for the NS5--brane in a D=10 type IIA supergravity background is obtained by carrying out the dimensional reduction of the M5--brane action.
111 <cond-mat> Generalized Thermostatistical Description of Intermittency and Non-extensivity in Turbulence and Financial Markets <sep> We describe a simple and accurate framework for modeling the statistical behavior of both fully developed turbulence and short-term dynamics of financial markets based on the formalism of Tsallis' generalized non-extensive thermostatistics. Within this framework, we show that intermittency and non-extensivity are naturally linked by the entropic parameter q. Our results, concerning both probability density functions and structure functions exponents are in very good agreement with experimental data.
296 <astro-ph.SR> Magnetic activity cycles in solar-like stars: The cross-correlation technique of p-mode frequency shifts <sep> Aims. We aim studying the use of cross-correlation techniques to infer the frequency shifts induced by changing magnetic fields in the p-mode frequencies and provide precise estimation of the error bars. Methods. This technique and the calculation of the associated errors is first tested and validated on the Sun where the p-mode magnetic behaviour is very well known. These validation tests are performed on 6000-day time series of Sun-as-a-star observations delivered by the SoHO spacecraft. Errors of the frequency shifts are quantified through Monte Carlo simulations. The same methodology is then applied to three solar-like oscillating stars: HD 49933, observed by CoRoT, as well as KIC 3733735 and KIC 7940546 observed by Kepler. Results. We first demonstrate the reliability of the error bars computed with the Monte Carlo simulations using the Sun. From the three analyzed stars we confirm the presence of a magnetic activity cycle with this methodology in HD 49933 and we unveil seismic signature of on going magnetic variations in KIC 3733735. Finally, the third star, KIC 7940546, seems to be in a quiet regime.
259 <astro-ph.CO> Rates of Superluminous Supernovae at z~0.2 <sep> We calculate the volumetric rate of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) based on 5 events discovered with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. We gather light curves of 19 events from the literature and our own unpublished data and employ crude k-corrections to constrain the pseudo-absolute magnitude distributions in the rest frame ROTSE-IIIb (unfiltered) band pass for both the hydrogen poor (SLSN-I) and hydrogen rich (SLSN-II) populations. We find that the peak magnitudes of the available SLSN-I are narrowly distributed ($M = -21.7 \pm 0.4$) in our unfiltered band pass and may suggest an even tighter intrinsic distribution when the effects of dust are considered, although the sample may be skewed by selection and publication biases. The presence of OII features near maximum light may uniquely signal a high luminosity event, and we suggest further observational and theoretical work is warranted to assess the possible utility of such SN 2005ap-like SLSN-I as distance indicators. Using the pseudo-absolute magnitude distributions derived from the light curve sample, we measure the SLSN-I rate to be about (32^{+77}_{-26}) events Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1} h_{71}^{3} at a weighted redshift of z = 0.17, and the SLSN-II rate to be about (151^{+151}_{-82}) events Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1} h_{71}^{3} at z = 0.15. Given that the exact nature and limits of these populations are still unknown, we discuss how it may be difficult to distinguish these rare SLSNe from other transient phenomena such as AGN activity and tidal disruption events even when multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, or even high resolution imaging are available. Including one spectroscopically peculiar event, we determine a total rate for SLSN-like events of (199^{+137}_{-86}) events Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1} h_{71}^{3} at z = 0.16.
350 <cond-mat.soft> Extreme softness of brain matter in simple shear <sep> We show that porcine brain matter can be modelled accurately as a very soft rubber-like material using the Mooney-Rivlin strain energy function, up to strains as high as 60\%. This result followed from simple shear experiments performed on small rectangular fresh samples ($2.5$ cm$^3$ and $1.1$ cm$^3$) at quasi-static strain rates. They revealed a linear shear stress--shear strain relationship ($R^2> 0.97 $), characteristic of Mooney-Rivlin materials at large strains. We found that porcine brain matter is about 30 times less resistant to shear forces than a silicone gel. We also verified experimentally that brain matter exhibits the positive Poynting effect of nonlinear elasticity, and numerically that the stress and strain fields remain mostly homogeneous throughout the thickness of the samples in simple shear.
289 <physics.soc-ph> <nlin.AO> <stat.AP> France new regions planning? Better order or more disorder ? <sep> This paper grounds the critique of the 'reduction of regions in a country' not only in its geographical and social context but also in its entropic space. The various recent plans leading to the reduction of the number of regions in metropolitan France are discussed, based on the mere distribution in the number of cities in the plans and analyzed according to various distribution laws. Each case, except the present distribution with 22 regions, on the mainland, does not seem to fit presently used theoretical models. Beside, the number of inhabitants is examined in each plan. The same conclusion holds. Therefore a theoretical argument based on entropy considerations is proposed, thereby pointing to whether more order or less disorder is the key question, - discounting political considerations.
324 <quant-ph> Low-cost error mitigation by symmetry verification <sep> We investigate the performance of error mitigation via measurement of conserved symmetries on near-term devices. We present two protocols to measure conserved symmetries during the bulk of an experiment, and develop a zero-cost post-processing protocol which is equivalent to a variant of the quantum subspace expansion. We develop methods for inserting global and local symetries into quantum algorithms, and for adjusting natural symmetries of the problem to boost their mitigation against different error channels. We demonstrate these techniques on two- and four-qubit simulations of the hydrogen molecule (using a classical density-matrix simulator), finding up to an order of magnitude reduction of the error in obtaining the ground state dissociation curve.
304 <nucl-ex> Hard Two-Photon Contribution to Elastic Lepton-Proton Scattering: Determined by the OLYMPUS Experiment <sep> The OLYMPUS collaboration reports on a precision measurement of the positron-proton to electron-proton elastic cross section ratio, $R_{2\gamma}$, a direct measure of the contribution of hard two-photon exchange to the elastic cross section. In the OLYMPUS measurement, 2.01~GeV electron and positron beams were directed through a hydrogen gas target internal to the DORIS storage ring at DESY. A toroidal magnetic spectrometer instrumented with drift chambers and time-of-flight scintillators detected elastically scattered leptons in coincidence with recoiling protons over a scattering angle range of $\approx 20\degree$ to $80\degree$. The relative luminosity between the two beam species was monitored using tracking telescopes of interleaved GEM and MWPC detectors at $12\degree$, as well as symmetric M{\o}ller/Bhabha calorimeters at $1.29\degree$. A total integrated luminosity of 4.5~fb$^{-1}$ was collected. In the extraction of $R_{2\gamma}$, radiative effects were taken into account using a Monte Carlo generator to simulate the convolutions of internal bremsstrahlung with experiment-specific conditions such as detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiency. The resulting values of $R_{2\gamma}$, presented here for a wide range of virtual photon polarization $0.456<\epsilon<0.978$, are smaller than some hadronic two-photon exchange calculations predict, but are in reasonable agreement with a subtracted dispersion model and a phenomenological fit to the form factor data.
217 <math.CO> Graphs whose flow polynomials have only integral roots <sep> We show if the flow polynomial of a bridgeless graph G has only integral roots, then G is the dual graph to a planar chordal graph. We also show that for 3-connected cubic graphs, the same conclusion holds under the weaker hypothesis that it has only real flow roots. Expressed in the language of matroid theory, this result says that the cographic matroids with only integral characteristic roots are the cycle matroids of planar chordal graphs.
244 <math.CV> <math.DG> K\"ahler-Einstein metrics and the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on log Fano varieties <sep> We prove the existence and uniqueness of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on Q-Fano varieties with log terminal singularities (and more generally on log Fano pairs) whose Mabuchi functional is proper. We study analogues of the works of Perelman on the convergence of the normalized K\"ahler-Ricci flow, and of Keller, Rubinstein on its discrete version, Ricci iteration. In the special case of (non-singular) Fano manifolds, our results on Ricci iteration yield smooth convergence without any additional condition, improving on previous results. Our result for the K\"ahler-Ricci flow provides weak convergence independently of Perelman's celebrated estimates.
147 <hep-th> <math-ph> <math.MP> <quant-ph> A non-commutative n-particle 3D Wigner quantum oscillator <sep> An n-particle 3-dimensional Wigner quantum oscillator model is constructed explicitly. It is non-canonical in that the usual coordinate and linear momentum commutation relations are abandoned in favour of Wigner's suggestion that Hamilton's equations and the Heisenberg equations are identical as operator equations. The construction is based on the use of Fock states corresponding to a family of irreducible representations of the Lie superalgebra sl(1|3n) indexed by an A-superstatistics parameter p. These representations are typical for p\geq 3n but atypical for p<3n. The branching rules for the restriction from sl(1|3n) to gl(1) \oplus so(3) \oplus sl(n) are used to enumerate energy and angular momentum eigenstates. These are constructed explicitly and tabulated for n\leq 2. It is shown that measurements of the coordinates of the individual particles gives rise to a set of discrete values defining nests in the 3-dimensional configuration space. The fact that the underlying geometry is non-commutative is shown to have a significant impact on measurements of particle separation. In the atypical case, exclusion phenomena are identified that are entirely due to the effect of A-superstatistics. The energy spectrum and associated degeneracies are calculated for an infinite-dimensional realisation of the Wigner quantum oscillator model obtained by summing over all p. The results are compared with those applying to the analogous canonical quantum oscillator.
336 <math.DS> Local rigidity for periodic generalised interval exchange transformations <sep> In this article we study local rigidity properties of generalised interval exchange maps using renormalisation methods. We study the dynamics of the renormalisation operator $\mathcal{R}$ acting on the space of $\mathcal{C}^{3}$-generalised interval exchange transformations at fixed points (which are standard periodic type IETs). We show that $\mathcal{R}$ is hyperbolic and that the number of unstable direction is exactly that predicted by the ergodic theory of IETs and the work of Forni and Marmi-Moussa-Yoccoz. As a consequence we prove that the local $\mathcal{C}^1$-conjugacy class of a periodic interval exchange transformation, with $d$ intervals, whose associated surface has genus $g$ and whose Lyapounoff exponents are all non zero is a codimension $g-1 +d-1$ $\mathcal{C}^1$-submanifold of the space of $\mathcal{C}^{3}$-generalised interval exchange transformations. This solves a particular case of a conjecture of Marmi-Moussa-Yoccoz.
330 <math.DS> Scaling functions for graph directed Markov systems <sep> We introduce the scaling function associated to a graph directed Markov system, and show that it is a H\"{o}lder continuous function of the dual symbolic Cantor set. With some natural separation and regularity conditions, each such system has a unique Cantor limit set in Euclidean space. We prove that the scaling function is a complete invariant of $ C^{1+\alpha} $ conjugacy between limit sets. We conclude by relating the scaling function to the pressure, and discussing several applications to the dimension theory of limit sets.
310 <cond-mat.quant-gas> Enhancing Kondo Coupling in Alkaline-Earth Atomic Gases with Confinement-induced Resonances in Mixed Dimensions <sep> The Kondo effect describes the spin-exchanging interaction between localized impurity and the itinerant fermions. The ultracold alkaline-earth atomic gas provides a natural platform for quantum simulation of the Kondo model, utilizing its long-lived clock state and the nuclear-spin exchanging interaction between the clock state and the ground state. One of the key issue now is whether the Kondo temperature can be high enough to be reached in current experiment, for which we have proposed using a transverse confinement to confine atoms into a one-dimensional tube and to utilize the confinement-induced resonance to enhance the Kondo coupling. In this work, we further consider the $1+0$ dimensional scattering problem when the clock state is further confined by an axial harmonic confinement. We show that this axial confinement for the clock state atoms not only plays a role for localizing them, but also can act as an additional control knob to reach the confinement-induced resonance. We show that by combining both the transverse and the axial confinements, the confinement-induced resonance can be reached in the practical conditions and the Kondo effect can be attainable in this system.
277 <cs.LO> EF+EX Forest Algebras <sep> We examine languages of unranked forests definable using the temporal operators EF and EX. We characterize the languages definable in this logic, and various fragments thereof, using the syntactic forest algebras introduced by Bojanczyk and Walukiewicz. Our algebraic characterizations yield efficient algorithms for deciding when a given language of forests is definable in this logic. The proofs are based on understanding the wreath product closures of a few small algebras, for which we introduce a general ideal theory for forest algebras. This combines ideas from the work of Bojanczyk and Walukiewicz for the analogous logics on binary trees and from early work of Stiffler on wreath product of finite semigroups.
176 <math.AC> On the structure of the fiber cone of ideals with analytic spread one <sep> Foa a given local ring, we study the fiber cone of ideals with analytic spread one. In this case, the fiber cone has a strucure as a module over its Noether normalization which is a polynomial ring in one variable over the residue field. One may then apply the structure theorem for graded modules over a graded principal domain to get a complete descriptionof the fiber cone as a module. We analyze this structure in order to study and characterize in terms of the ideal itself the aritmetical properties and other numerical invariants of the fiber cone as multiplicity, reduction number or Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.
281 <cond-mat.soft> <cond-mat.stat-mech> Rigidity percolation by next-nearest-neighbor braces on generic and regular isostatic lattices <sep> We study rigidity percolation transitions in two-dimensional central-force isostatic lattices, including the square and the kagome lattices, as next-nearest-neighbor bonds ("braces") are randomly added to the system. In particular, we focus on the differences between regular lattices, which are perfectly periodic, and generic lattices with the same topology of bonds but whose sites are at random positions in space. We find that the regular square and kagome lattices exhibit a rigidity percolation transition when the number of braces is $\sim L\ln L$, where $L$ is the linear size of the lattice. This transition exhibits features of both first order and second order transitions: the whole lattice becomes rigid at the transition, whereas there exists a diverging length scale. In contrast, we find that the rigidity percolation transition in the generic lattices occur when the number of braces is very close to the number obtained from the Maxwell's law for floppy modes, which is $\sim L$. The transition in generic lattices is a very sharp first-order-like transition, at which the addition of one brace connects all small rigid regions in the bulk of the lattice, leaving only floppy modes on the edge. We characterize these transitions using numerical simulations and develop analytic theories capturing each transition. Our results relate to other interesting problems including jamming and bootstrap percolation.
320 <cs.LG> <cs.AI> <stat.ML> Reinforcement Learning for Fair Dynamic Pricing <sep> Unfair pricing policies have been shown to be one of the most negative perceptions customers can have concerning pricing, and may result in long-term losses for a company. Despite the fact that dynamic pricing models help companies maximize revenue, fairness and equality should be taken into account in order to avoid unfair price differences between groups of customers. This paper shows how to solve dynamic pricing by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques so that prices are maximized while keeping a balance between revenue and fairness. We demonstrate that RL provides two main features to support fairness in dynamic pricing: on the one hand, RL is able to learn from recent experience, adapting the pricing policy to complex market environments; on the other hand, it provides a trade-off between short and long-term objectives, hence integrating fairness into the model's core. Considering these two features, we propose the application of RL for revenue optimization, with the additional integration of fairness as part of the learning procedure by using Jain's index as a metric. Results in a simulated environment show a significant improvement in fairness while at the same time maintaining optimisation of revenue.
215 <nucl-th> From 0 to 5000 in $2\times 10^{-24}$ seconds: Entropy production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions <sep> We review what is known about the contributions to the final entropy from the different stages of a relativistic nuclear collision, including recent results on the decoherence entropy and the entropy produced during the hydrodynamic phase by viscous effects. We then present a general framework, based on the Husimi distribution function, for the calculation of entropy growth in quantum field theories, which is applicable to the earliest ("glasma") phase of the collision during which most of the entropy is generated. The entropy calculated from the Husimi distribution exhibits linear growth when the quantum field contains unstable modes and is asymptotically equal to the Kolmogorov-Sina\"i (KS) entropy. We outline how the approach can be used to investigate the problem of entropy production in a relativistic heavy-ion reaction from first principles.
261 <math.PR> Sensitivity of mixing times <sep> In this note, we demonstrate an instance of bounded-degree graphs of size $n$, for which the total variation mixing time for the random walk is decreased by a factor of $\log n/ \log\log n$ if we multiply the edge-conductances by bounded factors in a certain way.
290 <cond-mat.mes-hall> Charge-Induced Spin Torque in Anomalous Hall Ferromagnets <sep> We demonstrate that spin-orbit coupled electrons in a magnetically doped system exert a spin torque on the local magnetization, without a flowing current, when the chemical potential is modulated in a magnetic field. The spin torque is proportional to the anomalous Hall conductivity, and its effective field strength may overcome the Zeeman field. Using this effect, the direction of the local magnetization is switched by gate control in a thin film. This charge-induced spin torque is essentially an equilibrium effect, in contrast to the conventional current-induced spin-orbit torque, and, thus, devices using this operating principle possibly have higher efficiency than the conventional ones. In addition to a comprehensive phenomenological derivation, we present a physical understanding based on a model of a Dirac-Weyl semimetal, possibly realized in a magnetically doped topological insulator. The effect might be realized also in nanoscale transition materials, complex oxide ferromagnets, and dilute magnetic semiconductors.
252 <q-bio.PE> Fluctuation analysis with cell deaths <sep> The classical Luria-Delbr\"uck model for fluctuation analysis is extended to the case where cells can either divide or die at the end of their generation time. This leads to a family of probability distributions generalizing the Luria-Delbr\"uck family, and depending on three parameters: the expected number of mutations, the relative fitness of normal cells compared to mutants, and the death probability of mutants. The probabilistic treatment is similar to that of the classical case; simulation and computing algorithms are provided. The estimation problem is discussed: if the death probability is known, the two other parameters can be reliably estimated. If the death probability is unknown, the model can be identified only for large samples.
291 <math-ph> <math.MP> <quant-ph> Generalized Bogoliubov transformations versus ${\mathcal{D}}$% -pseudo-bosons <sep> We demonstrate that not all generalized Bogoliubov transformations lead to $\cal D$-pseudo-bosons and prove that a correspondence between the two can only be achieved with the imposition of specific constraints on the parameters defining the transformation. For certain values of the parameters we find that the norms of the vectors in sets of eigenvectors of two related apparently non self-adjoint number-like operators possess different types of asymptotic behavior. We use this result to deduce further that they constitute bases for a Hilbert space, albeit neither of them can form a Riesz base. When the constraints are relaxed they cease to be Hilbert space bases, but remain $\cal D$-quasi bases.
321 <cs.AI> Temporal Answer Set Programming on Finite Traces <sep> In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach to Temporal Answer Set Programming that relies on a variation of Temporal Equilibrium Logic (TEL) for finite traces. This approach allows us to even out the expressiveness of TEL over infinite traces with the computational capacity of (incremental) Answer Set Programming (ASP). Also, we argue that finite traces are more natural when reasoning about action and change. As a result, our approach is readily implementable via multi-shot ASP systems and benefits from an extension of ASP's full-fledged input language with temporal operators. This includes future as well as past operators whose combination offers a rich temporal modeling language. For computation, we identify the class of temporal logic programs and prove that it constitutes a normal form for our approach. Finally, we outline two implementations, a generic one and an extension of clingo.
338 <physics.optics> Optical Parametric Amplification of Mid-Infrared Few-Cycle Pulses <sep> We describe Ti:Sapphire pumped optical parametric amplification of carrier-envelope phase stabilized few-cycle ($<10$fs) mid-infrared pulses in type I $\beta$-barium borate. Experimental measurements show a $\times3.5$ amplification factor (from 100$\mu$J to 350$\mu$J) of the octave spanning spectrum ($1.1-2.4$$\mu$m) using a pump beam with 2.3mJ energy, 30fs duration and central wavelength of 800nm, corresponding to an energy extraction efficiency of $11\%$. Numerical simulations suggest potential amplification to 4.25mJ energy and temporal compression to a pulse duration of 7.3fs is possible with a pump energy of 30mJ and duration of 30fs in a 25mm diameter, 1.5mm thick BBO crystal.
188 <hep-ph> Emerging Theory of Strongly Coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma <sep> RHIC data have shown robust collective flows, including recent spectacular ``conical flow'' from quenched jets: that confirms that QGP above the critical line is in a strongly coupled regime. One way to study Non-Abelian classical strongly coupled plasmas is via molecular dynamics, which was recently extended to plasmas with electric and magntic charges. First results on its transport (diffusion and viscosity) are reported. AdS/CFT correspondence is another actively pursuit approach to strong coupling regime: we review new results for heavy quark motion and even complete picture of conical flow, obtained from linearized gravity dual. Recent developments in (non-linearized) gravity aims at reproduction of the whole time-dependent picture of the explosion. We finally compare transport properties obtained from RHIC data to those obtained in MD and AdS/CFT.
331 <astro-ph.SR> Standard Magnetic Field Production at Huairou Solar Observing Station <sep> The regular solar observations are operated at Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS) since 1987, which make the construction of long-term magnetic field datasets available to understand solar magnetic field and cycles. There exist some inconveniences for solar physicist to use these data, because the data storage medium and format at HSOS experienced some changes. Additionally, the processes of magnetic field calibration are not easy to deal with for who are not familiar with these data. Here shows that the magnetic field of HSOS are further processed toward international standards, in order to explore HSOS observations data for scientific research.
72 <cond-mat> Quantum relaxation in open chaotic systems <sep> Using the supersymmetry technique, we analytically derive the recent result of Casati, Maspero and Shepelyansky [cond-mat/9706103] according to which the quantum dynamics of open chaotic systems follows the classical decay up to a new quantum relaxation time scale $t_q\sim\sqrt{t_c t_H}$. This scale is larger than the classical escape time $t_c$ but still much smaller than the Heisenberg time $t_H$. For systems with orthogonal or unitary symmetry the quantum decay is slower than the classical one while for the symplectic case there is an intermediate regime in which the quantum decay is slightly faster.
192 <hep-th> <math.DG> Symplectic potentials and resolved Ricci-flat ACG metrics <sep> We pursue the symplectic description of toric Kahler manifolds. There exists a general local classification of metrics on toric Kahler manifolds equipped with Hamiltonian two-forms due to Apostolov, Calderbank and Gauduchon(ACG). We derive the symplectic potential for these metrics. Using a method due to Abreu, we relate the symplectic potential to the canonical potential written by Guillemin. This enables us to recover the moment polytope associated with metrics and we thus obtain global information about the metric. We illustrate these general considerations by focusing on six-dimensional Ricci flat metrics and obtain Ricci flat metrics associated with real cones over L^{pqr} and Y^{pq} manifolds. The metrics associated with cones over Y^{pq} manifolds turn out to be partially resolved with two blowup parameters taking special (non-zero)values. For a fixed Y^{pq} manifold, we find explicit metrics for several inequivalent blow-ups parametrised by a natural number k in the range 0<k<p. We also show that all known examples of resolved metrics such as the resolved conifold and the resolution of C^3/Z_3 also fit the ACG classification.
65 <cond-mat> <nlin.PS> <patt-sol> Instabilities and disorder of the domain patterns in the systems with competing interactions <sep> The dynamics of the domains is studied in a two-dimensional model of the microphase separation of diblock copolymers in the vicinity of the transition. A criterion for the validity of the mean field theory is derived. It is shown that at certain temperatures the ordered hexagonal pattern becomes unstable with respect to the two types of instabilities: the radially-nonsymmetric distortions of the domains and the repumping of the order parameter between the neighbors. Both these instabilities may lead to the transformation of the regular hexagonal pattern into a disordered pattern.
350 <physics.atom-ph> <quant-ph> Hyperfine-mediated effects in a Lu$^+$ optical clock <sep> We consider hyperfine-mediated effects for clock transitions in $^{176}$Lu$^+$. Mixing of fine structure levels due to the hyperfine interaction bring about modifications to Land\'e $g$-factors and the quadrupole moment for a given state. Explicit expressions are derived for both $g$-factor and quadrupole corrections, for which leading order terms arise from the nuclear magnetic dipole coupling. High accuracy measurements of the $g$-factors for the $^1S_0$ and $^3D_1$ hyperfine levels are carried out, which provide an experimental determination of the leading order correction terms.
227 <astro-ph.CO> The nature of the LINER in the galaxy NGC 404 <sep> NGC 404, at a distance of 3.4 Mpc, is the nearest S0 galaxy. This galaxy harbors a LINER; however, since the spectrum does not show a broad H{\alpha} emission, it is not certain that this LINER is a low luminosity AGN and its nature is still an open question. HST observations show the existence of stellar populations with an age of 3 x 10^8 years years in the galactic bulge and with an age of 6-15 x 10^9 years in the galactic disk. In this work, we present an analysis of the data cube of NGC 404 obtained with the IFU (Integral Field Unity) of the GMOS (Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph) on the Gemini North telescope.
290 <math.OA> The nuclear dimension of C*-algebras associated to homeomorphisms <sep> We show that if X is a finite dimensional locally compact Hausdorff space, then the crossed product of C_0(X) by any automorphism has finite nuclear dimension. This generalizes previous results, in which the automorphism was required to be free. As an application, we show that group C*-algebras of certain non-nilpotent groups have finite nuclear dimension.
220 <cond-mat.supr-con> <cond-mat.dis-nn> Symmetry and disorder of the vitreous vortex lattice in an overdoped BaFe_{2-x}Co_xAs_2 superconductor: Indication for strong single-vortex pinning <sep> The disordered flux line lattice in single crystals of the slightly overdoped aFe_{2-x}Co_xAs_2 (x = 0.19, Tc = 23 K) superconductor is studied by magnetization measurements, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and magnetic force microscopy (MFM). In the whole range of magnetic fields up to 9 T, vortex pinning precludes the formation of an ordered Abrikosov lattice. Instead, a vitreous vortex phase (vortex glass) with a short-range hexagonal order is observed. Statistical processing of MFM datasets lets us directly measure its radial and angular distribution functions and extract the radial correlation length \zeta. In contrast to predictions of the collective pinning model, no increase in the correlated volume with the applied field is observed. Instead, we find that \zeta decreases as 1.3*R1 ~ H^(-1/2) over four decades of the applied magnetic field, where R1 is the radius of the first coordination shell of the vortex lattice. Such universal scaling of \zeta implies that the vortex pinning in iron arsenides remains strong even in the absence of static magnetism. This result is consistent with all the real- and reciprocal-space vortex-lattice measurements in overdoped as-grown aFe_{2-x}Co_xAs_2 published to date and is thus sample-independent. The failure of the collective pinning model suggests that the vortices remain in the single-vortex pinning limit even in high magnetic fields up to 9 T.
11 <hep-th> Uniqueness of the Axionic Kerr Black Hole <sep> Under the axisymmetry and under the invarance of simultaneous inversion of time and azimuthal angle, we show that the axionic Kerr black hole is the ${\it unique}$ stationary solution of the minimal coupling theory of gravity and the Kalb-Ramond field, which has a regular event horizon, is asymptotically flat and has a finite axion field strength at event horizon.
183 <astro-ph> Can we use Gamma Ray Bursts to probe high redshift star-formation? <sep> We present a detailed analysis of the selection effects that plague GRB observations. We find that these effects may partially explain the different redshift distributions between BeppoSax/HETE2 and Swift bursts. It is mandatory to consider these effects to determine the redshift evolution of GRBs.
352 <math.AG> <math-ph> <math.MP> Tamarkin-Tsygan Calculus and Chiral Poisson Cohomology <sep> We construct and study some vertex theoretic invariants associated to Poisson varieties, specialising in the conformal weight $0$ case to the familiar package of Poisson homology and cohomology. In order to do this conceptually we sketch a version of the \emph{calculus}, in the sense of \cite{TT}, adapted to the context of vertex algebras. We obtain the standard theorems of Poisson (co)homology in this \emph{chiral} context. This is part of a larger project related to promoting non-commutative geometric structures to chiral versions of such.
209 <cond-mat.mtrl-sci> Temperature dependent dynamic and static magnetic response in magnetic tunnel junctions with Permalloy layers <sep> Ferromagnetic resonance and static magnetic properties of CoFe/Al2O3/CoFe/Py and CoFe/Al2O3/CoFeB/Py magnetic tunnel junctions and of 25nm thick single-layer Permalloy(Py) films have been studied as a function of temperature down to 2K. The temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic resonance excited in the Py layers in magnetic tunnel junctions shows knee-like enhancement of the resonance frequency accompanied by an anomaly in the magnetization near 60K. We attribute the anomalous static and dynamic magnetic response at low temperatures to interface stress induced magnetic reorientation transition at the Py interface which could be influenced by dipolar soft-hard layer coupling through the Al2O3 barrier.
